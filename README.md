   * Scatter Plot - Each scatter represents a paragraph. The x-axis represents the certainty of the labels, whereas the y-axis represents the word count. The colour is dependent on the sentiment and the certainty of the label.
   * Pie Chart - Each pie segment represents the number of paragraphs with the corresponding label, and the colour is based on the average certainty of that label across the whole text.
